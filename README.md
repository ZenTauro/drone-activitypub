# USAGE
This bot will inspect the status of a drone repo and
publish it to a server that speaks activitypub (ie, mastodon)

The first time you use it, it will ask you to authenticate
with the mastodon server, it will ask you to follow some
steps and then you will need to save the data you can use
the following script:

## Script
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# The message to post:
# See below how to customize the posted message
export DRONE_OWNER=$drone_owner

# Mastodon variables
export DRONE_MASTODON_URL=$your_instance
export DRONE_MASTODON_DATA=$leave_empty

# ./target/release/drone-activitypub
docker run \
    -e DRONE_MESSAGE=${DRONE_MESSAGE} \
    -e DRONE_MASTODON_URL=${DRONE_MASTODON_URL} \
    -e DRONE_MASTODON_DATA=${DRONE_MASTODON_DATA} \
    --rm zentauro/drone-activitypub:v2.0.0
```

## Inside drone
This is an example of how to use it:
```yml
---
kind: pipeline
name: mastodon

steps:
- name: message
  image: "zentauro/drone-activitypub:0.0.1"
  settings:
    message: $message_template
    mastodon_url: $mastodon_url
    mastodon_data: $mastodon_auth_data
```

# Message templates
```yml
message: |
  {{ #success build.status }}
    Build {{ build.number }} pushed by {{ commit.author }} caused by {{ build.event }} at {{ repo.name }} succeded
  {{ else }}
    Build {{ build.number }} pushed by {{ commit.author }} caused by {{ build.event }} at {{ repo.name }} failed
  {{ /success }}
```

The plugin developer docs aren't really clear about what variables are passed to
the plugins, so please take this list with a grain of salt as it is a best effort.

## Template variables
- **repo.owner**: repository owner
